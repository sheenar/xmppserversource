**Pre-requisite:**
	Laptop with Java installed.(Preferably Windows - which was the developer test environment)

**Steps to run the server**
	- Copy xmppserver folder to system. eg: "D:\xmppserver"
	- Open cmd prompt (Goto Start->Run->cmd)
	- Goto the directory where the "xmppserver" folder is copied. eg:"cd /d D:\xmppserver"
	- Run the below commands :
		"javac -cp *;.; XMPPServerApp.java"
		"java -cp *;.; XMPPServerApp"	


Now the Server will start running and open the UI console.

Disclaimer :
	Even if this step fails, you can try to continue with app demo because I will try to host the server at my place.
